# .NET - Demo Web Application

This is a simple .NET web app using the new minimal hosting model, and Razor pages. It was created from the `dotnet new webapp` template and modified adding custom APIs, Bootstrap v5, Microsoft Identity and other packages/features.

The app has been designed with cloud native demos & containers in mind, in order to provide a real working application for deployment, something more than "hello-world" but with the minimum of pre-reqs. It is not intended as a complete example of a fully functioning architecture or complex software design.

Typical uses would be deployment to Kubernetes, demos of Docker, CI/CD (build pipelines are provided), deployment to cloud (Azure) monitoring, auto-scaling

The app has several basic pages accessed from the top navigation menu, some of which are only lit up when certain configuration variables are set (see 'Optional Features' below):

- **Info** - Will show system & runtime information, and will also display if the app is running from within a Docker container and Kubernetes.
- **Tools** - Some tools useful in demos, such a forcing CPU load (for autoscale demos), and error/exception pages for use with App Insights or other monitoring tool.
- **Monitoring** - Displays realtime CPU load and memory working set charts, fetched from an REST API and displayed using chart.js
- **Weather** - (Optional) Gets the location of the client page (with HTML5 Geolocation). The resulting location is used to fetch a weather forecast from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/)
- **User Account** - (Optional) When configured with Azure AD (application client id and secret) user login button will be enabled, and an user-account details page enabled, which calls the Microsoft Graph API

# Running and Testing Locally

### Pre-reqs

- Be using Linux, WSL or MacOS, with bash, make etc
- [.NET 6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux) - for running locally, linting, running tests etc
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - for running as a container, or image build and push
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux) - for deployment to Azure

Clone the project to any directory where you do development work

```
git clone https://github.com/benc-uk/dotnet-demoapp.git
```

### Makefile

A standard GNU Make file is provided to help with running and building locally.

```txt
$ make

Web app will listen on the usual Kestrel port of 5000, but this can be changed by setting the `ASPNETCORE_URLS` environmental variable or with the `--urls` parameter ([see docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel?view=aspnetcore-6.0)).
